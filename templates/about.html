        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            The Stroke Prediction System is an AI-driven healthcare project aimed at helping individuals assess their risk of stroke through a simple, accessible web interface. 
            Early detection of risk factors can significantly reduce the impact of strokes and save lives.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            Our system uses a machine learning model trained on real-world health data to analyze key indicators such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Age</li>
            <li>Gender</li>
            <li>Hypertension and Heart Disease History</li>
            <li>Average Glucose Level</li>
            <li>Body Mass Index (BMI)</li>
            <li>Smoking Status</li>
            <li>Residence Type</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Based on the data you provide, the system calculates the likelihood of a stroke and provides a result instantly. This can help you take proactive steps by consulting a healthcare provider.
        </p>

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Strokes are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. However, they are often preventable through early lifestyle changes and medical intervention. 
            By offering a quick and easy way to assess your risk, our system empowers users to take charge of their health.
        </p>

        <h2>Technology Behind It</h2>
        <p>
            The Stroke Prediction System is powered by Python, Flask, and machine learning models built using scikit-learn or TensorFlow. 
            The model has been trained on thousands of anonymized patient records to ensure accurate predictions.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
        <p>
            We are committed to using AI responsibly in healthcare and ensuring that every userâ€™s data remains secure and confidential. This system does not store any personal information after prediction.
        </p>
